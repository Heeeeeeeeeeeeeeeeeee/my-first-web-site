<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is <strong><u>a programming language</u> that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,</strong> alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">web browsers</a>, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
